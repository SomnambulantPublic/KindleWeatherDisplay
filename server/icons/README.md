I mixed, merged, and modified a number; and created a few myself (which I also release under Creative Commons licence)

Most I have added invisible nodes to make the bounding box exactly 100x100 px to assist in positioning

Advice should you decide to do some yourself:  
* take your time to learn Inkscape, including all the options in the Path menu, and the difference between Objects, Paths, Strokes. Consider absolute coordinates, I think it helped;  
* then learn how to manually edit the svg files in a text editor to remove excess data Inkscape adds (not too difficult).  
* The weather-script-preprocess.svg was typed, not generated (excluding cut/paste for icon defs) (layout and design decisions are actually the hard part here).  
* When positioning icons, if you scale up/down, the x axis of translation is also multiplied (y is not) so divide desired x position by scale-factor.
